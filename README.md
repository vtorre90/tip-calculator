# tip-calculator-app


I developed an app calculator designed to split the bill at the restaurant and calculate the tip!

With some imperfections on the UX and copy side ... but that's another story!

In particular, some of the imperfections are:
ðŸ™… the "number of people"'s field should be placed after the entering bill's input field
ðŸ™… Buttons should 32px in height for greater usability mobile side

Entirely made with #javascript #html #css & #passion
